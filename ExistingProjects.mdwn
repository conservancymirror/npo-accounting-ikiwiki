There are a number of existing accounting projects. Some of these are listed under <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_accounting_software>.

**If your project isn't listed here, feel free to add it!**

These projects will be evaluated for suitability and/or adaptability.  We
have an [[template you can use|ExistingProjects/EvaluationTemplate]] to
evaluate these projects to the UseCases we've collected so far.

## Projects Temporarily Rejected

These projects have been rejected temporarily (i.e., evaluation is on hold)
because of some issue that seems unresolvable at the moment, but may be
resolved at a later date and will remove the blocker of looking more closely
at the project.

* [[ExistingProjects/BeansBooks]]
  * [Not free software](https://beansbooks.com/home/opensource)
    * The developers have been reached in an effort to solve this issue.
* [[ExistingProjects/OpenPetra]]
  * The linux client has not been a focus of the OpenPetra developers, and as of 2013-11-25 with the setup described in <http://www.pokorra.de/2013/11/install-openpetra-on-linux/> it crashes intermittently for various reasons.
* [[ApacheOFBiz]]
  * Contacted
  * As a user: Due to OFBiz's apparent lack of documentation, e.g. <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBENDUSER/12.2.6+Reports>, the evaluation has been discontinued.
* [[ExistingProjects/Kuali]]
  * Contacted
  * As a developer: Discontinued due to the opacity of the Kuali organization.
* [[ExistingProjects/Bookyt]]
  * Contacted
     * Replied to my inquiriy about help with evaluating Bookyt but has not contributed any evaluations so far.
  * As a user: The project seems to be in an early state, if anyone would like to spin it up and try it you're welcome.
* [[ExistingProjects/ADempiere]]
  * As a user: ADempiere is hard to get clear information about, the resources that are available are hard to navigate.

## Projects Rejected

These projects have been evaluated as part of this effort and rejected, both
for a basis of this project or for any code reuse.  A few of the primary
reasons are given on this page, but the whole evaluation can be read on the
linked page.

* [[ExistingProjects/Frontaccounting#final-eval]]
  * Straight PHP with no framework
  * Data model somewhat messy, accounting not clearly separated.
  * Only one or two developers.
  * Workflow not easily configured.
* [[ExistingProjects/webERP]]: <http://www.weberp.org/> NOTE: [[Frontaccounting|ExistingProjects/Frontaccounting]] is a fork of webERP.
  * A brief look at the source code seems to indicate that webERP suffers from the same issues as Frontaccounting.
* [[ExistingProjects/GNUEnterprise]] 
> GNU Enterprise is not a Finance/ERP/Accounting software (yet). While the original project goal was to create exactly that, the maintainers at that time decided that as a first step, good development tools for database centered applications should be created. The focus of development then was strongly on these tools, and while they are to a certain extent usable to actually create database applications, further development in the project has come to a halt because most (all) developers shifted their energy to other projects.  
 -- Reinhard Mueller
* [[ExistingProjects/Garradin]]
  * Entirely in french, would need l10n, i18n and might not be suitable for US or international use. *Disclaimer: I cannot read french, these are assumptions.*
