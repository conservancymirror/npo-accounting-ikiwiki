There are a number of existing accounting projects. Some of these are listed under <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_accounting_software>.

**If your project isn't listed here, feel free to add it!**

These projects will be evaluated for suitability and/or adaptability.  We
have an [[template you can use|ExistingProjects/EvaluationTemplate]] to
evaluate these projects to the UseCases we've collected so far.

## Projects Temporarily Rejected
<a id="temp-reject"></a>

These projects have been rejected temporarily (i.e., evaluation is on hold)
because of some issue that seems unresolvable at the moment, but may be
resolved at a later date and will remove the blocker of looking more closely
at the project.
   
## Projects Rejected
<a id="rejected"></a>

These projects have been evaluated as part of this effort and rejected, both
for a basis of this project or for any code reuse.  A few of the primary
reasons are given on this page, but the whole evaluation can be read on the
linked page.

* [[ExistingProjects/Frontaccounting#final-eval]]
  * Straight PHP with no framework
  * Data model somewhat messy, accounting not clearly separated.
  * Only one or two developers.
  * Workflow not easily configured.
* [[ExistingProjects/GNUEnterprise]] 
> GNU Enterprise is not a Finance/ERP/Accounting software (yet). While the original project goal was to create exactly that, the maintainers at that time decided that as a first step, good development tools for database centered applications should be created. The focus of development then was strongly on these tools, and while they are to a certain extent usable to actually create database applications, further development in the project has come to a halt because most (all) developers shifted their energy to other projects.  
 -- Reinhard Mueller
* [[ExistingProjects/Garradin]]
  * Entirely in french, would need l10n, i18n and might not be suitable for US or international use. *Disclaimer: I cannot read french, these are assumptions.*
* [[ExistingProjects/BeansBooks]]
  * [Not free software](https://beansbooks.com/home/opensource)
  * The developers have been reached, not yet replied.
