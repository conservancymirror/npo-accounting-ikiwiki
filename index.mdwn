About This Wiki
===============
This wiki is powered by [[ikiwiki]], which allows for the Wiki contents to be stored in Git.

There is a
[mirror on Gitorious as well](https://gitorious.org/conservancy/npo-acct-wiki/),
but [due to a bug in Gitorious](https://issues.gitorious.org/issues/333),
this mirror isn't up to date.  We push to that repository on a regular basis,
though.
[hello](http://tut.by)
In the meantime, if you'd like write access via Git to this wiki, please just
[ask for it on the mailing list](https://lists.sfconservancy.org/mailman/listinfo/npo-accounting)
or ping joar or bkuhn on
