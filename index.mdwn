NPO Accounting Software Project
====================

[Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) is leading an
[effort to create accounting software for non-profit organizations](https://sfconservancy.org/npoacct/).

Current Status
==============

We're currently developing a Reimbursement and Payment Request system.  We
believe this is a relatively standalone component that other organizations
could start using quickly.  Check out the [[project page|Reimbursements]].
