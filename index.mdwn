NPO Accounting Software Project
====================

[Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) is leading an
[effort to create accounting software for non-profit organizations](https://sfconservancy.org/campaign/).

Conservancy welcomes the help of anyone who is interested in this issue to
design and develop this software.  If you want to get involved right now,
look below for [[information about how to get involved with this project|#howtohelp]].


BTW, we're [[hoping to participate in GSoC 2014|GSoC2014Ideas]].  We think
there are enough ideas for probably only one, maybe two, students.


## Phase 0

Initially, during Phase 0 of this project,
Conservancy is doing the following things:

- [Writing a tutorial on a Ledger-CLI setup for fiscal sponsor 501(c)3 organizations](https://gitorious.org/ledger/npo-ledger-cli/).
- [[Finding and evaluating existing Free Software accounting systems|ExistingProjects]].
- [[Writing use cases for non-profit accounting|UseCases]].

## Phase 1

Phase 0 is nearly complete, and in Phase 1, we plan to:

- [Create an REST API for basic double-entry accounting, currently using Ledger-CLI as a backend](http://npoacct.sfconservancy.org/accounting-api/)
- Add functionality to that API that already exists in the [documented Ledger-CLI setup for NPO's](https://gitorious.org/ledger/npo-ledger-cli/).
- Create various reports using that API, to flush out improvements that are needed.

About This Wiki
===============
This wiki is powered by [[ikiwiki]], which allows for the Wiki contents to be stored in Git.

There is a
[mirror on Gitorious as well](https://gitorious.org/conservancy/npo-acct-wiki/),
but [due to a bug in Gitorious](https://issues.gitorious.org/issues/333),
this mirror isn't up to date.  We push to that repository on a regular basis,
though.
In the meantime, if you'd like write access via Git to this wiki, please just
[ask for it on the mailing list](https://lists.sfconservancy.org/mailman/listinfo/npo-accounting)
or ping joar or bkuhn on
[#npoaccount on irc.freenode.net](irc:irc.freenode.net/npoacct).  You should
however be able to edit this Wiki using the web interface, too.

This Wiki also has a [[SandBox]].
