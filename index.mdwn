NPO Accounting Software Project
====================

[Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) is leading an
[effort to create accounting software for non-profit organizations](https://sfconservancy.org/campaign/).

Conservancy welcomes the help of anyone who is interested in this issue to
design and develop this software.  If you want to get involved right now,
look below for [[information about how to get involved with this project|index#howtohelp]].

## Phase 0

Conservancy has done the following:

- [Writing a tutorial on a Ledger-CLI setup for fiscal sponsor 501(c)3 organizations](https://gitorious.org/ledger/npo-ledger-cli/).
- [[Finding and evaluating existing Free Software accounting systems|ExistingProjects]].
- [[Writing use cases for non-profit accounting|UseCases]].

## Phase 1

Phase 1 calls for the project to:

- [Create an REST API for basic double-entry accounting, currently using Ledger-CLI as a backend](http://npoacct.sfconservancy.org/accounting-api/)
- Add functionality to that API that already exists in the [documented Ledger-CLI setup for NPO's](https://gitorious.org/ledger/npo-ledger-cli/).
- Create various reports using that API, to flush out improvements that are needed.
