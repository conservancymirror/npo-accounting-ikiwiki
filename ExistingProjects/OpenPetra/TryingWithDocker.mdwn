To try [[OpenPetra]] with docker:

First download the [[OpenPetra]] source code by running `bzr branch lp:openpetraorg`. This might take up to 40 minutes depending on the connection speed.

1. Install `lxc-docker`
2. [Create a base image](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/baseimages/) for docker, verify that the image has been created by running `docker images`, it should output something similar to <pre>REPOSITORY          TAG                 ID                  CREATED             SIZE

Oops, I've been thinking of [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) all this time.

1. Download vagrant: <http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.3.5>
