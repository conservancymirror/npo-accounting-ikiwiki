Actually not named "GNUCach" but GnuCash although it is part of the GNU Project.

## Technical

- C/C++ with CMake + make
- Scheme

## Preliminary evaluation

### Positive

- [Cross-platform](http://www.gnucash.org/)
- [Track record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuCash#Users) with 501(c)3 orgs.
- [Very mature codebase](http://www.ohloh.net/p/gnucash)

### Negative

- Uses svn for source code management.

### Comments

Josh Berkus: from my perspective, this has all of the drawbacks of ledger-cli, without the advantages.
