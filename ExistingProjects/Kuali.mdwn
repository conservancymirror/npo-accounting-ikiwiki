## Technical

- Java

## Preliminary evaluation

Kuali seems like a complex set of machinery, with many projects or distributions with different attributes.

- Partially under "All rights reserved" licensing: http://testdrive.kfs.kuali.org/kfs-ptd/acknowledgements.jsp, should not be an issue.

### Positive

- Backed by Kuali Foundation.

### Negative

- No public source control.
- No open community channels such as mailing list, message board, IRC channel. This makes it very hard to find information about Kuali. The documentation is also very inconvenient as every section is a separate page, making it hard to get an overview of how Kuali works and its capabilities.
