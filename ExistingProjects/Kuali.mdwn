## Technical

- Java

## Preliminary evaluation

Kuali seems like a complex set of machinery, with many projects or distributions with different attributes.

- Partially under "All rights reserved" licensing: http://testdrive.kfs.kuali.org/kfs-ptd/acknowledgements.jsp, should not be an issue.

### Positive

- Backed by Kuali Foundation.

### Negative

- No public source control.
- No open community channels such as mailing list, message board, IRC channel.
