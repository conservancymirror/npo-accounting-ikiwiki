## Preliminary evaluation

### Positive

- [Most recent release 2013-09-05](http://frontaccounting.com/wb3/pages/posts/release-2.3.18193.php)
- Themable
- Seemingly easy to deploy (Looking at their source release, structure looks similar to wordpress, for good or worse)

### Negative

- It seems to be built from scratch and not leverage any frameworks.
- Seems like a messy codebase: Table-based design. No templating, HTML is `echo`-ed to stdout.
