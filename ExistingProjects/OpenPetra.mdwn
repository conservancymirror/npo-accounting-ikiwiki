- [Decreasing Y-O-Y commits](http://www.ohloh.net/p/openpetraorg) <pre>2013-11-13 16:10:00     christiank      joar: I have checked for the source of increased commits in January 2011: It is a mixture of a huge bug-fixing spree and the result of a merge-into-trunk of a Sideline Branch, which then still needed more development</pre>

2013-11-13 16:09:36     robp    quick reply re: fund accounting (and, to clarify, I'm not a "finance expert" but do have a good understanding of what the finance module in Petra - the percursor to OpenPetra - does)...as Tim points out we need to know from our finance users where Petra falls short of the requirements for fund accounting. Based on my rudimentary understanding of the term, I would think that much of what is needed for fund accounting can be achived with out Cost Centre structu

## [[UseCases/Collaborating]] evaluation

## [[UseCases/GeneratingReports]] evaluation

<pre>
2013-11-13 16:25:25     joar    and then about generating reports: http://npoacct.sfconservancy.org/UseCases/GeneratingReports/, ping robp
2013-11-13 16:26:36     TimIngham       Open Petra generates a lot of different types of reports
2013-11-13 16:27:17     TimIngham       At first it may be difficult to see which are the "standard" accounting ones, but I expect they're there.
2013-11-13 16:27:31     TimIngham       And if they're not, it's certainly our intention to add them.
2013-11-13 16:28:22     christiank      The Finance Module of (Open)Petra is very much written so that it is 'auditor-friendly' AND easy to use.
2013-11-13 16:28:48     christiank      - even for not-trained book-keepers.
2013-11-13 16:29:23     christiank      I mean users who aren't trained accountants, but learn accounting in the organisation on-the-job.
2013-11-13 16:31:57     christiank      joar: Not sure if numbers are important, but a quick check revealed that there are at least 32 Reports in the Finance Module of OpenPetra.
2013-11-13 16:34:30     christiank      joar: It has to be mentioned that OpenPetra is developed as a 'global solution' and hence some terms perhaps esp. in the Finance Module might deviate from US-specific terms.
2013-11-13 16:36:25     christiank      A bookkeeper (read: bkuhn in your case) would need to have a close look at what functionatlity in the Finance Module of OpenPetra does what to find those potential differences.
