## Final(-ish) Evaluation
<a id="final-eval"></a>

Unfortunately, we discovered
[this policy early in our evaluation](https://github.com/webnotes/erpnext#copyright-for-contributors),
and decided that until this policy can be corrected to something more fitting
with actual copyright law and that will allow us to contribute under the
stated license of the project, it's not worth further evaluation of the codebase,
since this policy is just not acceptable.
