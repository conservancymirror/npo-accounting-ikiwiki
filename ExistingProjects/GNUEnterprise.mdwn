## Technical

## Preliminary evaluation

- GNUe-dev mailing list is not very active: <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnue-dev/>
- GNUe mailing list is not very active: <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnue/>
- No GNUe announcements since 2009: <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnue-announce/>
- I can get the bazaar repo and then get all the GNUe packages by running `./bin/bzr-get-all`, each of the GNUe packages then have an `INSTALL` file in its subdirectory but I cannot find meta-installation instructions for GNUe anywhere.
