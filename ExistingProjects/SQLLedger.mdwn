### Comments

Josh Berkus:  I was an early (uncredited) contributor to SQL-Ledger, and part of the fork.  The reasons we created the fork:
- Many known security holes (reference early LedgerSMB releases, which fix these.  They are still not fixed in current SQLLedger)
- Primary developer hostile to outside contributions, and did not credit the contributions he did receive.  Also relicensed contributions without permission.  I know, because some of the contributions were mine.
- Basically the primitive ancestor of LedgerSMB
