As an US-based NPO I need a way to *generate reports* in order to:

- Send the reports to an auditor
- Forward them to organization members.

The usual reports an NPO is expected to generate, and all of these should be generatable for any given date period:

- <a id="trial-balance"/> [Trial balance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_balance)
- <a id="bank-reconciliation"/> [Bank Reconciliation Report](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_reconciliation)
    + This report often needs to be generated with input from the user, since [the subset sum problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem) is [NP-complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete), human intervention is often needed to identify the specific transactions to show on this report.
-  <a id="chart-of-accounts"/> [Chart of accounts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_of_accounts)
-  <a id="cash-disbursements"/> Cash Disbursements Journal
- <a id="income-report"/> Income Report (just a list/sum of all Income accounts for a period)
- <a id="expenses-report"/> Expenses Report  (just a list/sum of all Expenses accounts for a period)
- [[Fund Report|UseCases/FundAccounting#FundReport]]

Also, To handle [[UseCases/FundAccounting]] all of these reports should be generatable narrowed to specific funds.
