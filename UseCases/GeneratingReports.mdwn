As an US-based NPO I need a way to *generate reports* in order to:

- Send the reports to an auditor
- Forward them to organization members.

The usual reports an NPO is expected to generate, and all of these should be generatable for any given date period:

- <a class="idOnly" id="trial-balance"></a>[Trial balance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_balance)
- <a class="idOnly" id="bank-reconciliation"></a> [Bank Reconciliation Report](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_reconciliation)
    + This report often needs to be generated with input from the user, since [the subset sum problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem) is [NP-complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete), human intervention is often needed to identify the specific transactions to show on this report.
-  <a class="idOnly" id="chart-of-accounts"></a> [Chart of accounts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_of_accounts)
-  <a class="idOnly" id="cash-disbursements">Cash Disbursements Journal</a>
- <a class="idOnly" id="income-report">Income Report</a> (just a list/sum of all Income accounts for a period)
- <a class="idOnly" id="expenses-report">Expenses Report</a>  (just a list/sum of all Expenses accounts for a period)
- [[Fund Report|UseCases/FundAccounting#FundReport]]

Also, To handle [[UseCases/FundAccounting]] all of these reports should be generatable narrowed to specific funds.
