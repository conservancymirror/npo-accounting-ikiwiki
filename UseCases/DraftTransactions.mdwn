# Generating Draft Transactions

As a manager at a nonprofit, I need the ability to have staff propose draft
transactions that are not added to the books official until approved.

As a bookkeeper, I'd like the ability to set up and review draft transactions
before officially adding them to the books, so I can see if they were entered
correctly.

It should be possible to view any [[reports|GeneratingReports]] or other
system information as if the draft transactions have been applied, via some
configurable option.
