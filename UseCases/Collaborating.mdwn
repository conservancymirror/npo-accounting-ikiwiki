As an accountant that collaborates with other accountants I need:

- Simultaneous editing of the same ledger
- In the case of decentralized ledgers, such as ledger-cli files shared via DVCS
  - Easy synchronization of entries from separate ledgers

in order to efficiently and collaboratively perform accounting tasks.
