As an accountant that collaborates with other accountants I need:


- <a class="idOnly" id="simultaneous-ledger-edits">Simultaneous editing of the same ledger</a>
- FIXME: this should probably be stated differently: In the case of decentralized ledgers, such as ledger-cli files shared via DVCS
  - Easy synchronization of entries from separate ledgers

in order to efficiently and collaboratively perform accounting tasks.
