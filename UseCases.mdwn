Feel free to add your own usecase to this list.

Resources on writing good use cases:

- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case>
- <http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/advantages-of-the-as-a-user-i-want-user-story-template>

A simple form of a use case is

> “As a \<type of user>, I want \<some goal> so that \<some reason>.”

You should add your use case as a subpage of the [[UseCases]] page, to create a new page, simply enter the name of the subpage in the address bar after `/UseCases/`.
